Real estate assets frequently are a major component of an estate's overall value and an important part of financial planning. We regularly prepare appraisals for estate and gift tax purposes as required by IRS regulations. These appraisals are prepared on the basis of a Fair Market Value as required by the Internal Revenue Service. Please contact us by phone or email for information about an appraisal for Estate or Gift Tax purposes.
