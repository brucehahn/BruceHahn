Real estate data has become readily available to everyone on the internet. Today one can easily find information about dozens of recent sales in a suburban or urban neighborhood. Traditional appraisals rely on three to six of these sales selected as the "best" by an appraiser. Valuation data science tools allow the analysis of all available and relevant sales. Data visualization helps aid in the understanding of a market and the influences on value based on the analysis of the Competitive Market Segment.

Data science is a blend of computing power, traditional statistics, and mathematics guided by domain expertise. We use valuation data science to create the most reliable and accurate valuations possible by considering all relevant sales information in a market area.
