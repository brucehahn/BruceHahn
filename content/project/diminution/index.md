Diminution in Market Value results from detrimental conditions. We have experience in the valuation of numerous kinds of detrimental conditions including landslides, subsidence, erosion, construction defects, and drainage problems. Sometimes detrimental conditions arise with the discovery of an easement previously not known to exist. 

Eminent Domain or condmenation also creates a detrimental condition for analysis purposes. All Diminution in Market Value problems require a before and after valuation analysis. The diminution is the difference between the before and after market values and we have considerable experience with these types of appraisals.
